### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


**MRedzinski02/MRedzinski02** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on creating this account
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning web page development and graphic design
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on a videogame or animated series a few years down the line
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about literally any of post malone's songs or albums
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Depart from Whiterun and head east to Ivarstead, where you will be greated by the seven thousand steps of High Hrothgar. Halfway through your journey up the Steps, you will be greeted (or in this case, provoked) by a feral Frost Troll, evade him or vanquish him, the choice is yours. Once your journey up the seven thousands steps, you must deposit one bowl of salt, and one package of dehydrated meats in the chest directly outside the temple entrance. Then, and only then, will you reach me. 
- *Alternative methods to reach me: canvas inbox*
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: my uncle was the stunt double for Freddy Kreuger in Nightmare on Elm Street lol
